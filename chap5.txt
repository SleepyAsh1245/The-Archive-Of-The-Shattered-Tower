Chapter V : The Lovers (VI) - The Bargain

	I stepped out of the observatory into the fog, the locket still clutched in my hand. The Devil card from the telescope mount felt heavier than before, as if reminding me of the chains I hadn’t yet broken. My path was no longer just about discovery—it was about choice.

The streets of Vespera were eerily quiet as I made my way to the docks, following the faint directions scribbled in the margins of the Tome. Then I saw him: Gideon. He leaned casually against a crate, eyes glinting like a predator watching prey.

"Well, well… Asher," he said, voice smooth, dangerous. "You’re a long way from… memory, aren’t you?"

I swallowed, tightening my grip on the locket. “I’m not here for you. I’m here for the first object.”

Gideon chuckled, the sound cutting through the fog like a blade. “Ah, the locket. Such a beautiful little thing. And I happen to have what you want… the Second Object.”

I felt a knot form in my stomach. I knew what he meant. The Tome had warned me—the journey would test me with bargains, with impossible choices. I squared my shoulders. “What’s your price?”

He smiled, and it wasn’t reassuring. “Simple. The locket. Trade it for the ledger. No tricks, no lies. The path continues, but only if you obey.”

My pulse quickened. The locket—my first object, my genesis of this journey—was the price. And yet… if I didn’t, the truth might remain forever out of reach.

"I don’t have a choice, do I?" I muttered under my breath.

Gideon’s eyes gleamed. “Oh, but you do. But choices… choices are the sweetest torture.”

I exhaled slowly, letting the weight of inevitability sink in. “Fine. Take it.”

I handed him the locket, watching as the brass slipped into his hands. A sharp pang of self-betrayal struck me, but I forced it down. In return, he handed me a worn, hard-backed ledger—the Second Object. And tucked beneath it, the same Tarot card: The Empress (III).

"Careful now," Gideon warned. “The path only widens… it doesn’t ease. You’ll need more than courage to see it through.”

I nodded, swallowing hard, my heart pounding in my chest. The weight of the Faustian bargain settled in my chest, heavy and immovable. I had betrayed the first step of my own journey to continue.

"I… I’ll see it through," I whispered to myself, clutching the ledger and card. The city’s fog pressed in around me, and I felt the chains of consequence tighten ever so slightly.

The path ahead was no longer just discovery—it was survival, choice, and the test of my own moral compass. The Lovers had spoken, and I had answered.
