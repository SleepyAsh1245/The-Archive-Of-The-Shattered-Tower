Chapter VII: Strength (VIII) – The Resilience of Guilt

	The city never slept, but that night, it felt like it was holding its breath. I sat in a dim motel room, the ledger spread open across the bed, its pages whispering things I didn’t want to hear.

Each entry was dated, signed, and precise—my handwriting, my tone, my arrogance. The words described Project Chronos: a network of neural anchors designed to rewrite and stabilize memory. At first glance, it looked like salvation. But the deeper I read, the darker it became.

"Subject responses consistent. Conscious morality deconstruction successful. Memory erasure irreversible."

I froze. The ink blurred for a moment as I stared at the phrase. “Irreversible.”

The weight of what I had done pressed against my chest like a vice. I had built something monstrous. A machine that didn’t just erase pain—it erased conscience.

"What were you thinking…?" I muttered to myself. “Who was I?”

My reflection in the motel window stared back, hollow-eyed and unrecognizable. I wanted to smash the glass, but I didn’t. Instead, I turned back to the Tome and flipped through the pages until I found the next card: Strength (VIII).

“Inner courage. Resilience in the face of guilt. The beast must be tamed, not slain.”

I laughed bitterly. “Inner courage. I built a weapon, not a memory tool.”

The sound of my voice echoed in the silence. For a moment, I thought I heard an answer—my own voice, distorted, whispering from the depths of memory:

"You did what had to be done."

I stood, heart pounding. “Who are you?”

No response. Just the creaking of the pipes and the hum of the neon outside. My hand trembled as I turned another page in the ledger. At the bottom of the last entry, written in hurried strokes, were words that made my blood run cold:

“The Third Object is guarded by the only living person who knows the cost of my ambition.”

“Z. helped secure the final anchor. She knows the cost.”

Zora. The Oracle.

I sat back, stunned. “She knew… she was part of it.”

The truth hit me like a storm. The woman who had handed me the Tome—the one who’d guided me—had been complicit all along.

The door creaked suddenly. My pulse spiked as I reached for the edge of the bed, gripping the ledger like a weapon.

"You’re digging deep, Asher."

It was Gideon again, his voice calm, almost amused. He stepped into the dim light, his gaze flicking to the ledger on the bed. “The beast is awake now, isn’t it?”

"You knew,” I said sharply. “You knew what Chronos was.”

"Of course I did," he replied smoothly. “I helped fund it. But you, Asher—you gave it purpose. You made it beautiful. Efficient. Ruthless.”

My jaw tightened. “It was supposed to preserve memory, not destroy it.”

"And yet here we are." He smirked. “You’re just starting to remember, aren’t you? That’s Strength, my friend. Painful, but necessary.”

He turned to leave but paused at the door. “When you’re ready for the next truth, follow the Wheel. It’s already turning.”

And then he was gone, leaving the words hanging in the air.

I stared at the Strength card, its illustration of a woman taming a lion seeming to flicker in the dim light. I wasn’t sure if I could tame my own beast, but I knew one thing: I couldn’t turn back.

The ledger, the Tome, the cards—they were all pointing toward the same inevitable confrontation.

And I wasn’t sure if I’d survive it.
