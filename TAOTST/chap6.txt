Chapter VI : The Chariot (VII) - Driven Progress

	I left the docks with the ledger pressed tightly against my chest, my fingers still tingling from the weight of the Faustian bargain. The fog of Vespera wrapped around me, thick and unrelenting, like the memory I could no longer access.

Gideon had disappeared as suddenly as he had appeared, leaving only the faint echo of his laughter and the lingering threat in the air. I glanced down at the Empress card, now familiar in my grip. Creation. Genesis. Fertility. And yet, I wondered bitterly if I had really created anything, or merely sacrificed the pieces I had been given.

The Tome whispered in my mind: “Forward motion is the only path. Momentum shields against stagnation, but beware… it drives both hero and fool alike.”

I walked the streets aimlessly at first, then faster, instinct guiding me toward the outskirts. The ledger weighed heavily in my bag, and flipping it open revealed cryptic entries, strange diagrams, and the faint echo of a name I almost recognized: Project Chronos.

"Chronos… what is this?" I muttered aloud, running a trembling hand over the pages. I didn’t recognize myself in the script, but the handwriting was unmistakably mine. A shiver ran down my spine.

From the shadows, a voice called out—smooth, commanding:

"Going somewhere, Asher?"

I spun. Gideon had returned, leaning against a lamppost, his silhouette sharp against the foggy glow. “You’re… everywhere,” I said, my voice tight with tension.

"Momentum," he replied, a wry smile on his lips. “The Chariot moves forward whether you want it to or not. And you, my friend, are moving at full speed now. Faster. Stronger. Or you fall.”

I clenched the ledger. “I don’t know what you want from me anymore.”

"The ledger, the path, the choice," he said. “Everything. But remember… it’s not about what I want. It’s about whether you can handle the motion you’ve set in place. The wheels are turning, Asher, and stopping is not an option.”

I stared at him, the fog swirling between us. There was truth in his words, even if it was venom-coated. The city itself seemed to push me forward, urging me not to pause, not to hesitate. I exhaled sharply, gripping the Empress card.

"Then I’ll move," I said, voice firmer than I felt. “Forward. No matter the cost.”

And I did. Every step pressed me deeper into the labyrinth of Vespera, toward revelations I wasn’t ready for, toward consequences I couldn’t yet comprehend. The Chariot moved me, not by my will, but by fate itself—and I could only hold on and hope I survived the journey it demanded.
