Chapter IV : Justice (XI) - The Reckoning

    The fog of Vespera seemed heavier tonight, thickening like the weight in my chest. I clutched the brass locket in one hand, the Empress card in the other, and the Tome of Arcana pressed against my side. The city felt alive, but not in a comforting way—it was a predator, and I was the prey.

The Tome whispered in my mind: “Justice waits where truth cannot be ignored.”

I found myself at the Cosmic Watch Observatory, its silhouette looming like a silent judge in the distance. The metal steps creaked under my weight as I ascended, each one echoing in the emptiness.

At the top, I set the locket on the telescope mount and touched it lightly. The moment my fingers brushed the cold metal, a vision tore through my mind.

I was standing at a vast dockyard. Night cloaked everything, but it was empty—eerily empty. And then the weight hit me: betrayal. I saw flashes—my own face, a masked figure, a ledger spilling secrets I didn’t remember writing. My breath caught.

"This… this is me," I whispered, staggering back from the vision. “All of it… the lies… the betrayals…”

The air hummed around me. I looked down, and there, as if placed by unseen hands, lay the next Tarot card: The Devil (XV).

I opened the Tome to its page. Bondage, materialism, choice of evil.

"I… I’m bound," I said aloud. “By my own hand… by my choices.” My hands shook. I pressed the locket closer, feeling the weight of responsibility and guilt.

The night wind brushed my face, carrying a whisper that seemed to echo from nowhere:

"You cannot run from what you created."

I turned to the horizon, the fog swirling around the observatory, and felt the first twinges of fear—not for myself, but for what the city might become if I failed.

"I have to keep going," I muttered. “If I stop… if I hide… there’s no redemption. Only collapse.”

The vision faded, leaving only the faint glow of the city below. I picked up The Devil card and tucked it into my bag. I was moving forward, propelled by Justice (XI) itself, though I wasn’t sure I had the strength to bear it.

And then I heard it—a distant voice, smooth and cold, carrying across the fog.

"Looking for answers, are we, Asher?"

I froze. That voice… it was familiar, predatory. My hands tightened around the locket.

"Who’s there?" I demanded, my voice steadier than I felt.

A shadow moved at the edge of the observatory. “Patience, seeker. Every choice has a cost. But the cards… they will show you the way. If you survive them.”

The figure vanished as suddenly as it appeared. My chest heaved. I knew, somehow, that the path forward would demand choices I might not survive.

Clutching the locket and the Tarot cards, I whispered into the cold night:

"I accept the cost. Show me the truth, no matter how cruel."

And with that, I stepped back from the telescope, my mind set on the next stage of the reckoning.
